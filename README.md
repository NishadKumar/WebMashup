# WebMashup
The goal of this project is to create a web mashup that combines two web services: Google Maps and the Zillow API, using JavaScript and AJAX. When one clicks on a house on the map, application will display the postal address and the estimated price of the house.

Application makes use of Google map's geocoding and reverse geocoding concepts.
